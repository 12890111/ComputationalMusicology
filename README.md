My Corpus exists out of 7 playlists forming 4 different groups. These 4 groups are: Blues, Jazz, Pink floyd and Scales. With 2 of the playlists I will research the changes between old and new blues songs, where one playlist coutains Blues songs from 1920 untill 1960 and the other playlist contains blues songs from the 21th century. With the 2 playlists belonging in the Jazz group I will look at what differs between West Coast Jazz (1950s Jazz in America) and Bossa Nova (A brazilian form of Jazz). Then, two other playlists will be used to see to what musical scales Americans and Europeans listen to. Maybe we listen to very different or similair scales. Lastly I will use a playlist with all Pink Floyd songs to see if their music has made noticable changes in their music after big events like when Rogar Waters left the band. And to for example see how their style has changed after a member of the band had left.    

I would like to know more about blues because it is a pretty old genre and I like to play it on guitar. The Jazz group seemed interesting to me because they consist out of 2 types of jazz from diefferent countries, America and Brazil. The other choices are out of personal interest and curiosity. The comparison points here are genres, artist, and scales. I expect the genres of Jaz and Blues to be different but I would not be suprised if they have some similarity aswell. How much they differ or overlap will be answered. For the artist I think some events have made the band better and sometimes worse. Which can be seen in the data. And with scales I suspect that we will listen to similair scales. Since the data I used is taken from the top 50 most streamed songs on a day in 2023. And the music taste of Americans and Europeans (espicialy of young people using spotify) seems to not be that different annymore. 

   Overall I think my corpus offers me the choice between 4 interesting groups to research. Each playlist has around 20-50 songs. Only the playlist of Pink floyd contains 172 songs. In the Pink floyd playlist I think there will be some typical tracks or whole albums like The Wall will see show more change in their popularity than others.
